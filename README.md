# 30 Days of Swift
Tracking my 30 day journey in learning Swift and IOS Development

# Week 1 

## Basic User Interface 

This first week of learning Swift I started with learning the basics of Apple's UIKit, learning about different aspects of the user interface from Labels, TextFeilds, Buttons, Images and more. I started with a basic app jus displaying some text and images. Through this process, I was able to work throgh the learning curve of the ins and outs of XCode

# Week 2 

## IBActions and Functionality 

Gaining some profiency in basics of Swift, I started to add more functionlity to my apps through the use of IBOutlets and IBActions. This allowed me to add interactions for the user with the app. I started by adding the functionality to my Dicee App, when the user presses the roll button, two random dice images are displayed on the screen. I was able to implement my knowledge of arrays and loops to make this possible.

I moved on to creating a quiz app with true or false answers. I learned more about code design, by using the Model View Controller Design Patter to structure my code. Furthermore, I learned about how to make more functional and reusable code through the use of Structs and Classes as well as new data structures like dictionaries. Some difficulties arrised in keeping track of the users score and resseting the score when the game was over.
