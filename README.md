# 30 Days of Swift
My 30 day journey in learning Swift and IOS Development

# Week 1 

## Basic UI Apps 

This first week of learning Swift I started with learning the basics of Apple's UIKit, learning about different aspects of the user interface from Labels, TextFeilds, Buttons, Images and more. I started with a basic app jus displaying some text and images. Through this process, I was able to work throgh the learning curve of the ins and outs of XCode
